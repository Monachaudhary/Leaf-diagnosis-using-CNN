<h3>Deep learning-based web application detecting leaf diseases in diverse plants and provide corresponding solution</h3>
This technology can assist farmers and agricultural researchers in obtaining reliable and timely disease diagnosis findings in plants. To determine the likely source of a plant illness, a leaves disease classification system is applied. It takes a picture of the plant’s leaf and then analyses the data using a statistical method based on the accuracy of the model. Diseases typically develop in the leaves, fruits, and buds. When a plant becomes sick, the crops and fruits and vegetables may be wasted or damaged. These diseases, in addition to being detrimental to the plant, can also contribute to the spread of new infections. It’s critical to recognise the disease ahead of time and take the appropriate actions to keep it from spreading to other trees. The purpose of this work is to create a system that can detect plant illnesses by combining image processing with leaf image categorization. We’re utilising a Convolutional Neural Network to complete this challenge.
